Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Harpreet Singh Slatch

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who loves solving problems and creating useful solutions. I have experience in coding, teamwork, and using agile methods to build projects. I adapt quickly, learn fast, and enjoy turning ideas into real projects. Outside of coding, I find inspiration through travel and family. Letâ€™s work together to build something great!

ðŸŒŸ About Me
My fascination with technology began in childhood with a love for video games, which motivated me to learn about tech. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in IT and experience in retail and telecommunications, Iâ€™ve cultivated teamwork, problem-solving, and customer service skills that complement my technical expertise.

Iâ€™m driven by the excitement of creating innovative web solutions and contributing to impactful projects. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and delivering high-quality work.

ðŸ’¼ Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express, Knex, SQLite3
Tools: Git, GitHub, Vitest, Docker
ðŸš€ Projects
Bite-Share
GitHub Repo
For my final project at Dev Academy, I worked with a team of three to create Bite-Share, a web app designed to reduce hunger and food waste by connecting individuals with surplus food to those in need.

Role: Backend and Vibes Lead
Managed migration tables, seeded data, implemented database query functions, and defined backend routes.
Contributed to the frontend, ensuring smooth backend integration with the user interface.
Facilitated daily stand-ups, and scheduled breaks, and fostered a positive team dynamic.
This project showcased my full-stack development skills and highlighted the power of collaboration in solving real-world problems.

ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s Next
Iâ€™m building an e-commerce platform to refine my skills in web development and deepen my understanding of React concepts from the book The Road to React. In my free time, youâ€™ll find me completing coding challenges, attending meetups, or working on personal projects that push my boundaries. Iâ€™m also reflecting on everything Iâ€™ve learned during bootcamp while exploring new opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and grow as a developer.

âš¡ When Iâ€™m Not Coding
I enjoy staying active through regular exercise and sports.
