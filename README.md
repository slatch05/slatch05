Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Harpreet Singh Slatch
Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who loves solving problems and creating useful solutions. I have experience in coding, teamwork, and using agile methods to build projects. I adapt quickly, learn fast, and enjoy turning ideas into real projects. Outside of coding, I find inspiration through travel and family. Letâ€™s work together to build something great!
